## Instructions

Connect Honeycomb to SuperPlane using a Management Key.

**Required configuration:**
- **Site**: US (api.honeycomb.io) or EU (api.eu1.honeycomb.io) based on your account region.
- **Management Key**: Found in Honeycomb under Team Settings > API Keys. Must be in format &lt;keyID&gt;:&lt;secret&gt;.
- **Team Slug**: Your team identifier, visible in the Honeycomb URL: honeycomb.io/&lt;team-slug&gt;.
- **Environment Slug**: The environment containing your datasets (e.g. "production"). Found under Team Settings > Environments.

SuperPlane will automatically validate your credentials and manage all necessary Honeycomb resources — webhook recipients for triggers and ingest keys for actions — so no manual setup is required.

## On Alert Fired

Starts a workflow execution when a Honeycomb Trigger fires.

**Configuration:**
- **Dataset Slug**: The slug of the dataset that contains your Honeycomb trigger. Found in the dataset URL: honeycomb.io/&lt;team&gt;/datasets/&lt;dataset-slug&gt;.
- **Trigger**: The exact name of the Honeycomb trigger to listen to (case-insensitive). Found in your dataset under Triggers.

**How it works:**
SuperPlane automatically creates a webhook recipient in Honeycomb and attaches it to the selected trigger. No manual webhook setup is required.

When the trigger fires, SuperPlane receives the webhook and starts a workflow execution with the full alert payload.

{
  "data": {
    "alert_type": "on_true",
    "description": "production environment:\nCurrent value greater than threshold value (5)",
    "id": "kQjkatCVK6M",
    "is_test": false,
    "name": "High Error Rate",
    "operator": "greater than",
    "result_groups": [
      {
        "Group": {},
        "Result": 8.5
      }
    ],

}
```

## Create Event

Sends a JSON event to a Honeycomb dataset.

Each key in the JSON object becomes a Honeycomb field.

Notes:
• Dataset must exist
• Fields must be valid JSON object
• Timestamp is auto-added if missing

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
