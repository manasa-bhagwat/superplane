## On Feature Flag Change

The On Feature Flag Change trigger starts a workflow execution when LaunchDarkly sends webhooks for feature flags in a project.

### Use Cases

- **Deployment automation**: Trigger deployments or rollbacks when a feature flag changes
- **Audit workflows**: Track and log changes to flags for compliance
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when a flag is created, updated, or deleted
- **Integration workflows**: Sync flag changes with external systems

### Configuration

- **Project**: The LaunchDarkly project to monitor
- **Environments**: Optionally filter by environment(s). Leave empty to receive events for all environments.
- **Feature Flags**: Optionally filter by specific flags or patterns. Leave empty to receive events for all flags.
- **Actions**: Optionally filter by specific actions (e.g. only when a flag is turned on or off). Leave empty to receive all actions.

### Webhook Setup

The webhook is automatically created in LaunchDarkly when you save the canvas. No manual setup is required.

SuperPlane uses the LaunchDarkly API (via your configured API access token) to create a signed webhook scoped to the selected project, and securely stores the auto-generated signing secret. When LaunchDarkly sends events, SuperPlane verifies the signature and filters to the configured environments, flags, and actions automatically.

## Delete Feature Flag

The Delete Feature Flag component permanently deletes a feature flag from a LaunchDarkly project.

### Use Cases

- **Flag cleanup**: Remove stale or temporary flags after rollout is complete
- **Automated lifecycle**: Delete flags as part of a release workflow
- **Maintenance workflows**: Clean up archived flags that are no longer needed

### Configuration

- **Project Key**: The key of the LaunchDarkly project containing the flag
- **Flag Key**: The key of the feature flag to delete (supports expressions)

### Output

Returns a confirmation payload with the deleted flag's project and flag keys.

**Warning**: This action is irreversible. Once deleted, the flag and all its targeting rules are permanently removed.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "deleted": true,
    "flagKey": "toggle-feature",
    "projectKey": "default"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "launchdarkly.flag.deleted"
}
```
